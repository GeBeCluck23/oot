beginseg
    name "example"
    romalign 0x1000
    include "build/assets/scenes/examples/example_scene.o"
    number 2
endseg

beginseg
    name "example_room_0"
    romalign 0x1000
    include "build/assets/scenes/examples/example_room_0.o"
    number 3
endseg	

- scene_table.h, add:
/* 0x6E */ DEFINE_SCENE(example, none, SCENE_EXAMPLE, SDC_DEFAULT, 0, 0)

- entrance_table.h, add:
(Must be 4 of them, named appropriately. The game knows which one to use for; child/day, child/night, adult/day, adult/night)
/* 0x618 */ DEFINE_ENTRANCE(ENTR_EXAMPLE_0,   SCENE_EXAMPLE, 0, false, false, TRANS_TYPE_FADE_BLACK, TRANS_TYPE_FADE_BLACK)
/* 0x619 */ DEFINE_ENTRANCE(ENTR_EXAMPLE_0_1, SCENE_EXAMPLE, 0, false, false, TRANS_TYPE_FADE_BLACK, TRANS_TYPE_FADE_BLACK)
